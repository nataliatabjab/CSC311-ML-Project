# CSC311-ML-Group-Project
This project investigates various approaches to predicting student responses to multiple-choice questions. We implement and compare k-nearest neighbors (kNN) collaborative filtering, Item Response Theory (IRT), a neural network autoencoder, and an ensemble of models, using real-world educational data from the Eedi platform.
